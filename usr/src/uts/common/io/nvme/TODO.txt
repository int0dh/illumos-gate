1) Remove all GEOM-support logic from the driver
2) Replace all uio's with bd_xfer_t.
3) Allocate the request queue statically? (nvme_controller::request_queue
and nvme_controller::free_queue)
 
So, when the request goes from BLKDEV to device, we
a) get the request structure from the free_queue
b) populate it with stuff from BLKDEV (bd_xfer_t ?)
c) put the request into the request queue and kick the controller.
d) wait for the completion ?


4) Remove all BSD DMA code/things from the code. All DMA actions
have to be done by BLKDEV
